My scene is a living room with bookshelves, tables, chairs and sofas. The living room is decaying and unkempt, with books sprawled across the sofa. There is a skeleton hunched over a table with an Ouija Board. The skeleton is trying to contact the dead, and it seems to be working. One of the chairs is toppled over on the side, while another hovers in mid air. A grimy lamp is lighting up the answer on the Ouija board. 

I included a skeleton, an Ouija board, a lamp, a bookshelf with a variety of objects, and furniture. I got the bookshelf and the furniture from their own asset packs. 

I was inspired by my liking for horror and thriller genres. I also thought this scene would be very fitting as we approach the end of October.

The main character of this scene is a skeleton.

*** Main Mechanics: The Scripted camera moves along with with the moving chair. The moving chair can be moved by the player by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The Change Camera button can be used to switch between the 4 different cameras.
